            <h2>Durability</h2>
            <p>This weapon has hit points equal to your Constitution stat. When you take damage as a result of being attacked or failing a saving throw as a result of a spell with this weapon equipped, if the attack roll was lower than 5 + your AC, this weapon takes damage as well. If you are wielding two Attacker and/or Gunner Triggers, only one of them takes damage at a time. If this weapon's hit points reach 0, this weapon is destroyed.</p>

            <h2>Durability</h2>
            <p>This weapon has hit points equal to 1.5 * your Constitution stat rounded up. When you take damage as a result of being attacked or failing a saving throw as a result of a spell with this weapon equipped, if the attack roll was lower than 5 + your AC, this weapon takes damage as well. If you are wielding two Attacker and/or Gunner Triggers, only one of them takes damage at a time. If this weapon's hit points reach 0, this weapon is destroyed.</p>
            <h2>Special</h2>
            <p>You can spend a bonus action to change this weapon into Shield Mode or back to Blade Mode. While in Shield Mode, your AC increases by 2, but it is treated as a shield, losing its attack action. While in Shield Mode, this weapon only takes damage from attack rolls higher than 2 + your AC, and does not takes damage from spells. Also, subtract damage equal to your Constitution modifier from all incoming damage unless you are being flanked.</p>

            <p>You conjure up to three small platforms that propel whatever touches their surface 10 ft in a jumpable direction. Each platform disappears once it propels something.</p>
            <p>While being propelled, you cannot be targeted for an attack of opportunity. Also, if you have an Attacker Trigger equipped, you can make a swipe attack on one creature that you pass by for each time you are propelled.</p>
            <p>Swipe Attack: Make a standard melee attack roll. On a hit, the target takes half damage.</p>
            <p>This Trigger costs 1 Trion Point to use for each platform you conjure.</p>

            <p>You have learned to use your Trigger Holder, but it requires Trion from your body. Starting at 1st level, you have Trion Points equal to 3 * your Constitution stat + 5. Activating your Trigger Holder and using Triggers will use these points, and you cannot use either without the necessary points. You can choose to regain Trion Points equal to your Constitution stat on completion of a short rest, but you will gain a level of exhaustion when doing so. Your Trigger Holder cannot be active when you do this. You regain all of your Trion Points on completion of a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Triggers</h5>
            <p>Your Trigger Holder has two columns, each with half the number of your accessible slots. It also has an additional slot for a Gunner Trigger. You can only use one Trigger from each column at a time (or one from your extra slot and one from either column), allowing a maximum of two Triggers at a time. You will gain access to more Triggers and Trigger slots as you gain levels in Trigger User.</p>
            <p>By spending time with tinker's tools and your Trigger Holder, you can swap out what Triggers are in your Trigger Holder. For every Trigger you swap out, youmust spend 1 hour.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you are capable of activating your Trigger Holder and have access to the Radar Trigger.</p>
            <p>Activating your Trigger holder takes a bonus action and automatically uses the Trion Body Trigger. When your Trigger Holder deactivates, your Trion Body disappears and is replaced by your physical body, and your Trigger Holder cannot be activated again for 5 minutes. You cannot spend Trion Points unless your Trigger Holder is active.</p>
            <h2>Trion Body (5 Trion Points)</h2>
            <p>Your physical body is replaced by a body made of Trion. While in your Trion Body, your physical body does not take damage. Remember that your Trion Body has your calculated hit points, while your physical body has hit points equal to your Constitution stat.</p>
            <p>When your Trion Body runs out of hit points, it is destroyed and your Trigger Holder deactivates.</p>
            <p>If your Trion Body is reduced to under 1/4 of its max hit points, the attack that caused it removes one of your Trion Body's limbs. In this state, you begin losing 2 Trion Points at the start of each of your turns. Being healed above 1/4 of its max hit points does not remove this effect. This effect is dismissed when your Trigger Holder is deactivated.</p>
            <p>If your Trigger Holder is deactivated while your Trion Body has more than half its max hit points, you regain 3 Trion Points.</p>

            <p>When using Asteroid, Hound, or Viper, or reloading a Gunner or Sniper Trigger that is equipped in your Trigger Holder's right column or extra slot, you can spend 4 Trion Points to gain the following effects for that use or reload.</p>
            <p>Using Shooter Triggers:  The shooter Trigger does not deal damage. Instead, on a hit, the target(s) loses movement speed equal to the number of damage dice they would have taken times 5 for 1 hour. If the target's movement speed drops to half their original value or below, the target(s) has disadvantage on Dexterity rolls for the duration as well.</p>
            <p>Reloading Gun-Types:  All attacks made with the Trigger you reload no longer deal damage. Instead, on a hit, the target loses 5 movement speed for every 3 clip ammo the attack uses (minimum 5 speed) for 1 hour. If the target's movement speed drops to half their original value or below, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity rolls for the duration as well. These effects are dismissed if you reload the affected Trigger again.</p>
